#+TITLE: TRIPS: [T]idal [R]esponse [I]n [P]lanetary [S]tructure
#+AUTHOR: David James

* Description
  The TRIPS code will produce the tidal response for the tidal numbers =k, h, l= 
  for some integer =l= that is the harmoinc degree such that =kl= represents the
  tidal number followed by the harmonic degree. The inputs for the driver method,
  =propagator_method=, will also take the amount of =layers= of the structure
  and a =data= variable which represents the structure of the plaent.
  - NOTE :: Benchmarks in the *Example* directory need to have their directory paths setup correctly to run
  - NOTE :: Benchmarks that require a specific data file will not run at the moment, because data files are not copied over yet

* Design
  The file structure of this code is as follows:
  - *README*: description of the source code
  - *app*: program that will call the source code
  - *src*: all the modules making up the TRIPS code
  - *test*: any testing on the src code
    - inverse method check
  - *example*: benchmarks from academic papers this code has performed
